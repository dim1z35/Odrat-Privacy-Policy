We minimize collection. Examples of possible data (only as necessary):

Operational logs (local by default): timestamps, errors, status messages — used for debugging and improvement.

Identifiers required for operation: e.g., Discord user IDs or server IDs — only if you configure integrations. Do not provide credentials for systems you are not authorized to test.

Crash reports & anonymized stats (optional): only if you opt-in.

We do not collect or transmit destructive payloads, secrets, or private data to the maintainer by default. Any telemetry requires explicit opt-in.

4. Lawful basis (where applicable)

Processing is based on consent (opt-in telemetry) or legitimate interest (local error logging), as applicable under local law.

Data generated by Odrat is stored locally by default. Any transmitted data (opt-in crash reports) is sent via TLS and retained only as necessary (default retention: 30 days).

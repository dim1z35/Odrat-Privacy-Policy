What data we collect & why
We aim to minimize data collection. Examples of data that MAY be collected while Odrat runs (and only to the extent necessary for functionality, debugging, or safety) include:

• Operational logs (local only by default): timestamps, errors, status messages generated by the Software while running. Used to debug and imaprove the Software.
• Identifiers required for operation: Where relevant, identifiers such as Discord user IDs or server IDs if you explicitly configure integrations. You must not provide credentials or identifiers for systems you are not authorized to test.
• Crash reports and anonymized usage statistics (optional): only if you opt in; helps improve the Software.

We do not collect or transmit destructive payloads, secrets, or private data to the maintainer by default. If you enable any telemetry or reporting, you will be asked explicitly and given details.

Lawful basis (if applicable)
If you are in a jurisdiction with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR), our lawful basis for processing is usually your consent (for optional telemetry) and legitimate interests (for error logging and safety), limited as described here.

How we store and protect data
Data generated by Odrat is stored locally on the machine where Odrat runs by default. If any data is transmitted (e.g., for opt-in crash reports), it will be sent securely over TLS to the maintainer and retained only as long as necessary (retention period: defaults to 30 days unless otherwise specified). We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect data in our control.

Sharing and disclosure
We will not sell personal data. We may disclose information:
• to comply with legal obligations or lawful requests;
• to investigate misuse or security incidents; or
• with your explicit consent.

Your rights (where applicable)
If applicable under your local law, you may request access to data we hold about you, correction, deletion, or portability. Contact https://discord.com/users/1338601214677483632/ with your request. We will respond within applicable legal timeframes.

Children’s privacy
Odrat is not intended for use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16. If you believe we have such data, contact us to request deletion.

Security incidents & breach notification
If a security incident affects data in our control, we will follow applicable laws and notify affected parties and authorities when required.

International data transfers
If any data is transferred across borders (e.g., to servers maintained by the developer in another country), we will take lawful steps to protect the data.

Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. Material changes will be notified by posting the new policy and updating the Effective Date.

Consent & opt-outs
Certain optional features (telemetry, crash reports) require your explicit opt-in. You can opt out at any time by changing configuration or contacting https://discord.com/users/1338601214677483632/
